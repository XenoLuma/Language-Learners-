# Language-Learners
On a personal note I am learning two languages myself and I got curious about how many other language learners are out there in the world. 
I discovered a dataset showcasing language learners in the Netherlands. After cleaning the original table in MySQL server I've extracted the data I was most curious about including a person's origin and there goal, what age the arrived and how long they've lived in the Netherlands, and there performance at there target language. 

Then I made a dashboard in Tableau showcasing language learners origin, target language, and performance by gender. I found some interesting facts including English is the most targeted language German speakers want to learn but Arabic speakers have a higher written understanding of English.
